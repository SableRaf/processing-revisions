# Processing Early Releases (2001-2005)
This repository is an ongoing archival project for early Processing releases. These _pre_, _alpha_, and _beta_ versions of Processing were initially released between the years 2001 and 2005. 

We believe these legacy versions and their release notes have historical value and are worth preserving. If you would like to help our conservation efforts, or if this work was helpful to you, [get in touch](#contacts)!

> If you are looking for the latest version of Processing go to the [Processing download page](https://processing.org/download)

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How to Download the Binaries

### [Full Archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H8E2eIymWTz3qYPOJakRNdkcG-0XjOib?usp=drive_link)
You can access and download the original `revisions` folder containing all binaries [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H8E2eIymWTz3qYPOJakRNdkcG-0XjOib?usp=drive_link).

### [Re-releases on GitHub](https://github.com/SableRaf/processing-revisions/releases) (WIP)
To make these files easier to navigate, we will also be uploading the binaries for each version as releases on this repository.

Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/SableRaf/processing-revisions/releases) and locate the release you want to download. Check the file extension to identify the correct version for your operating system: macOS (`hqx`, `dmg`, `sit`, `sitx`), Windows (`zip`, `exe`), or Unix systems (`tgz`).

> [!WARNING]
> GitHub automatically creates two extra files called `Source code (zip)` and `Source code (tar.gz)`. These files were not part of the original release and you may safely ignore them.

## üôä Disclaimers
The versions of Processing featured on this repository were released between 2001 and 2005. These legacy releases are provided "as is", bugs and all, for their historical value and to support conservation efforts. Many of these versions were unstable or had various issues, often released in quick succession to fix bugs from previous versions. For technical details, refer to the included release notes, and check the release dates for an idea of each version's stability. We do not provide support or bug fixes for these very early versions of Processing. However, if you find a problem with this repository, such as a corrupted archive, or a wrong file in a release, please file an issue. 

The archival process **is a work in progress**, starting with `processing-0001.sit` (pre-release) and working all the way up to `processing-0104-expert.zip` (beta release). In total this is 287 individual files to upload, tag, and check by hand. If you want to help this archival effort, please contact hello@processing.org.
